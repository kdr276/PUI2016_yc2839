a. verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly
- I was confused about yc2839 formulation, and the null hypothesis do not prove the idea if rejected. 
- the Idea was stated as: "Was there a differnce of tripduration between the first half and the second half of a month ( e.g. January 2015)?"
- and the Null Hypothesis: "biking tripdurations in first half of January (2015) was more than the second half."
- Rejecting the Null Hypothesis do not prove that there is difference, because rejecting it just state that the first half has no longer 
trip durations comparing to the second half. To have a difference it also can be different to less tripduration.
- I would change the idea to look more direct to: Is tripdurations on 1st half of the month less than tripdurations of  2nd half of the month?

b. verify that the data supports the project:
- The data available to test is adequate.
- The data was cleaned correctly.
- yc2839 choose the trip duration, time and created a category indicating if it is 1st or 2nd half. All necessary information to test.

c. Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data
- Since yc2839 want to measure the difference between two groups, choosing as IV the time (1st or 2nd half), I suggest to try a z-test.
