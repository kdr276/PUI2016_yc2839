For HW_3, I worked with the group whose member are Xiaomeng Dong, Cheng Hou, and Yuxuan Han.

Assignment 1, it went pretty smoothly since we have the sample code from HW3_fb55.  

Assignment 2, we spent much time on working out how to stored the CitiBike data in env. variable PUIDATA, then we discussed many potential hypothesis which might appealing to people. Finally, we picked up a topic to do it individually (clean data and plot)… 

Assignment 3, we had a great reference from the class note slide (UI3_2016.pdf ‘z-score’)
