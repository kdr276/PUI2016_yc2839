For this assignment:  
I created a directory on compute called PUI2016_yc2839.
I created an environmental variable on my compute called PUI2016 (With XiaoMeng's help).
I created an alias which takes me to the created dirctory (PUI2016_yc2839) on my compute (with XiaoMeng and Cheng Hou's help).  
* How to set up EV, watch a video on Youtube called "How to setup OS X EL Capitan Environment Variables(Create, Read, Update, Delete)".  
* How to set up alias, google COOLEST GUIDES ON THE PLANET to see the instruction.  
* Compute Hope gives the best ideas on what is EV and alias.
