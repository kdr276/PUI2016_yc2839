I did this homework under XiaoMeng Dong and ZhaoHong Niu's help (After they had sumbitt thier homework due on Monday)
For this homework, I learned to write a python script, which I found they are actully working script of python. (py. format is upload from Jupyter, and upload into Gitbub dirctory and commit the change). I learned to use a website API key to reqiure data (in the format of JSON file) and learned to conver the information into csv file. Niu helped me greately in the Assignment 1 and 2, in terms of how to write the script and how to use the 'Jsonviwer' to view the data. I also learned to use panads to read CSV files (from NYC OpenData) and make a plot according to the selected data table. I did this part with XiaoMeng and she also gave me great advice to choose a file that finally works.
